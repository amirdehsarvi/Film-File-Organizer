# filmdatabase

If you have a folder with random mp4, mkv, avi, etc. files for different films, you can use this script to go through the files for you and sort them by "/Director/ReleaseYear - Title/FilmFile".

The script uses the IMDB database to complete the process and is able to rename the file accordingly. You will be asked to confirm that the information is correct.
